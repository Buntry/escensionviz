# Escension Visualization

Practicing visualization skills on messaging data from my Discord Server

### How to get started

Clone the repository, then navigate to that directory with your terminal.
If python is installed, you can use the command `python -m SimpleHTTPServer` to
launch a server so that you can run the visualization. All code to be edited
can be found in the `js` directory.
